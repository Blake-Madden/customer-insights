# Measures overview

Measures help you to better understand customer behaviors and business performance. They look at relevant values from [unified profiles](data-unification.md). For example, a business wants to see the *total spend per customer* to understand an individual customerâ€™s purchase history or measure *total sales of the company* to understand the aggregate-level revenue in the whole business. Some [service limits](/dynamics365/customer-insights/service-limits) apply.

Create measures to plan business activities by querying customer data and extract insights. For example, create a measure of *total spend per customer* and *total return per customer* to help identify a group of customers with high spend yet high return. Then, [create a segment](segments.md) based on these measures to drive next best actions.

Go to the **Measures** page to view the measures you created, their status, measure type, and the last time the data was refreshed. You can sort the list of measures by any column or use the search box to find the measure you want to manage.

Select next to a measure to view available actions. Select the measure name to preview the output and download a CSV file.

- **Edit** the measure to change its properties.
- **Refresh** the measure to include the latest data.
- **Rename** the measure.
- **Activate** or **Deactivate** the measure. Inactive measures won't get refreshed during a [scheduled refresh](#schedule-measures) and have the **Status** listed as **Skipped**, indicating that a refresh wasn't even attempted.
- **Tag** to [manage tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#manage-tags) for the measure.
- **Delete** the measure.
- [**Schedule**](#schedule-measures) the measure.
- **Columns** to [customize the columns](work-with-tags-columns.md#customize-columns) that display.
- **Filter** to [filter on tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#filter-on-tags).
- **Search name** to search by measure name.

## Schedule measures

Measures can be refreshed on the [scheduled system refresh](schedule-refresh.md), weekly, monthly, or refreshed manually on demand. You might want to schedule last season's measures or measures that don't change often on a slower cadence such as monthly to avoid unnecessary processing time. The default is every scheduled system refresh.

Define refresh schedules for one or more measures. The currently defined schedule is listed in the **Schedule** column of the measure list.

1. Go to **Measures**.

1. Select the measures you want to schedule.

1. Select **Schedule**.

1. In the **Schedule** pane, set the **Schedule run** to **On** to run the measure automatically. Set it to **Off** to refresh it manually.

1. For automatically refreshed measures, select **Recurrence** and the details for it. On the scheduled day, the refresh occurs after the scheduled system refresh.
