# Measures overview

Measures help you to better understand customer behaviors and business performance. They look at relevant values from [unified profiles](data-unification.md). For example, a business wants to see the *total spend per customer* to understand an individual customerâ€™s purchase history or measure *total sales of the company* to understand the aggregate-level revenue in the whole business.

Create measures to plan business activities by querying customer data and extract insights. For example, create a measure of *total spend per customer* and *total return per customer* to help identify a group of customers with high spend yet high return. Then, [create a segment](segments.md) based on these measures to drive next best actions.

- **Edit** the measure to change its properties.
- **Refresh** the measure to include the latest data.
- **Rename** the measure.

- **Tag** to [manage tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#manage-tags) for the measure.
- **Delete** the measure.
- [**Schedule**](#schedule-measures) the measure.
- **Columns** to [customize the columns](work-with-tags-columns.md#customize-columns) that display.
- **Filter** to [filter on tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#filter-on-tags).
- **Search name** to search by measure name.

## Schedule measures

Measures can be refreshed on the [scheduled system refresh](schedule-refresh.md), weekly, monthly, or refreshed manually on demand. The default is every scheduled system refresh. For example, you might want to schedule measures that don't change often or are for last season on a slower cadence such as monthly to avoid unnecessary processing time.

Define refresh schedules for individual measures or several measures at once. The currently defined schedule is listed in the **Schedule** column of the measure list.

1. Go to **Measures**.

1. Select one or more measures you want to schedule.

1. Select **Schedule**.

1. In the **Schedule** pane, set the **Schedule run** to **On** to run the segment automatically. Set it to **Off** to refresh it manually.

1. For automatically refreshed measures, select the **Recurrence** value and the details for it. On the scheduled day, the refresh occurs during the time of the scheduled system refresh.

1. When defining the schedule for several measures, make a selection under **Keep or override schedules**:
   - **Keep individual schedules**: Keep the previously defined schedule for the selected measures and only disable or enable them.
   - **Define new schedule for all selected Measures**: Override the existing measures of the selected segments.

1. Select **Save**.

1. To view the next refresh scheduled for a measure, on the **Measures** page, select **Columns** and add the **Next refresh** column.
