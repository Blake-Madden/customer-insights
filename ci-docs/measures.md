# Measures overview

Measures help you to better understand customer behaviors and business performance. They look at relevant values from [unified profiles](data-unification.md). For example, a business wants to see the *total spend per customer* to understand an individual customerâ€™s purchase history or measure *total sales of the company* to understand the aggregate-level revenue in the whole business. Some [service limits](/dynamics365/customer-insights/service-limits) apply.

Create measures to plan business activities by querying customer data and extract insights. For example, create a measure of *total spend per customer* and *total return per customer* to help identify a group of customers with high spend yet high return. Then, [create a segment](segments.md) based on these measures to drive next best actions.
