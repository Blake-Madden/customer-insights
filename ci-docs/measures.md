# Measures overview

Measures help you to better understand customer behaviors and business performance. They look at relevant values from [unified profiles](data-unification.md). For example, a business wants to see the *total spend per customer* to understand an individual customerâ€™s purchase history or measure *total sales of the company* to understand the aggregate-level revenue in the whole business. Some [service limits](/dynamics365/customer-insights/service-limits) apply.

Create measures to plan business activities by querying customer data and extract insights. For example, create a measure of *total spend per customer* and *total return per customer* to help identify a group of customers with high spend yet high return. Then, [create a segment](segments.md) based on these measures to drive next best actions.

Select next to a measure to view available actions. Select the measure name to preview the output and download a CSV file.

> [!TIP]
> Supported bulk operations include: refresh, delete, change state (activate/deactivate), and tags.

- **Edit** the measure to change its properties.
- **Refresh** one or more measures to include the latest data.
- **Rename** the measure.
- **Activate** or **Deactivate** the measure. For multiple measures, select **Change state**. Inactive measures won't get refreshed during a [scheduled refresh](schedule-refresh.md) and have the **Status** listed as **Skipped**, indicating that a refresh wasn't even attempted.
- **Tag** to [manage tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#manage-tags) for one or more measures.
- **Delete** one or more measures.
- [**Schedule**](#schedule-measures) one or more measures.
- **Columns** to [customize the columns](work-with-tags-columns.md#customize-columns) that display.
- **Filter** to [filter on tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#filter-on-tags).
- **Search name** to search by measure name.

## Schedule measures

Measures can be refreshed on the [scheduled system refresh](schedule-refresh.md), weekly, monthly, or refreshed manually on demand. You might want to schedule last season's measures or measures that don't change often on a slower cadence such as monthly to avoid unnecessary processing time. The default is every scheduled system refresh.

### Prerequisites for automatic refresh of a measure

- A [system refresh must be scheduled](schedule-refresh.md). Daily system refresh is recommended.
- The custom schedule for a measure must align with the system refresh schedule.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > If the system refresh date is changed after you have scheduled custom schedules for your measures so that the dates no longer align, your measures won't run. Change your measures custom schedules to align with the new system refresh schedule.

### Create custom refresh schedules for measures

Define refresh schedules for one or more measures. The currently defined schedule is listed in the **Schedule** column of the measure list.

1. Go to **Measures**.

1. Select the measures you want to schedule.

1. Select **Schedule**.

1. In the **Schedule** pane, set the **Schedule run** to **On** to run the measure automatically. Set it to **Off** to refresh it manually.

1. For automatically refreshed measures, select **Recurrence** and the details for it.

1. When defining the schedule for several measures, make a selection under **Keep or override schedules**:
   - **Keep individual schedules**: Keep the previously defined schedule for the selected measures.
   - **Define new schedule for all selected measures**: Override the existing schedules of the selected measures.
