# Remove duplicates before unifying data

This optional step in unification enables you to set up rules for eliminating duplicate records **within** an entity. Deduplication identifies multiple records for a customer and selects the best record to keep (based on basic merge preferences) or merges the records into one (based on advanced merge preferences). Source records get linked to the merged record with alternate IDs. If rules are not configured, system-defined rules are applied.

## Default deduplication

The system-defined rules apply if no deduplication rules are added.

- Deduplicate on primary keys

  Records with the same primary key are deduplicated. The winning record is the MAX(PK), meaning the first of the duplicate records in the data set is selected as the winner.

- Deduplicate by applying cross-entity matching rules

  On the matching conditions step, any rules used to match an entity to another entity are applied as a deduplication rule to that entity. For example: If a rule matches entity A to entity B on *FullName* and *DateofBirth*, then entity A and Entity B are also deduplicated by *FullName* and *DateofBirth*. Because *FullName* and *DateofBirth* are used to match unique customers across entities, they are also used to identify and remove duplicate customers in each entity.

## Include enriched entities (preview)

If you enriched entities on the data source level to help improve your unification results, select them. For more information, see [Enrichment for data sources](data-sources-enrichment.md).

1. On the **Duplicate records** page, select **Use enriched entities** at the top of the page.

1. From the **Use enriched entities** pane, choose one or more enriched entities.

1. Select **Done**.

## Define deduplication rules

1. On the **Duplicate records** page, select an entity and select **Add rule** to define the deduplication rules.

   1. In the **Add rule** pane, enter the following information:
      - **Select field**: Choose from the list of available fields from the entity that you want to check for duplicates. Choose fields that are likely unique for every single customer. For example, an email address, or the combination of name, city, and phone number.
      - **Normalize**: Select from following normalization options for the selected attributes.
        - **Numerals**: Converts other numeral systems, such as Roman numerals, to Arabic numerals. *VIII* becomes *8*.
        - **Symbols**: Removes all symbols and special characters. *Head&Shoulder* becomes *HeadShoulder*.
        - **Text to lower case: Converts all character to lower case**. *ALL CAPS and Title Case* becomes *all caps and title case*.
        - **Type (Phone, Name, Address, Organization)**: Standardizes names, titles, phone numbers, addresses, etc.
        - **Unicode to ASCII**: Converts unicode notation to ASCII characters. */u00B2* becomes *2*.
        - **Whitespace**: Removes all spaces. *Hello   World* becomes *HelloWorld*.
      - **Precision**: Set the level of precision to apply for this condition.
        - **Basic**: Choose from *Low (30%)*, *Medium (60%)*, *High (80%)*, and *Exact (100%)*. Select **Exact** to only match records that match 100 percent.
        - **Custom**: Set a percentage that records need to match. The system will only match records passing this threshold.
      - **Name**: Name for the rule.

      :::image type="content" source="media/m3_duplicates_add.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add rule pane for removing duplicates.":::

   1. Optionally, select **Add** > **Add condition** to add more conditions to the rule. Conditions are connected with a logical AND operator and thus only executed if all conditions are met.

   1. Optionally, **Add** > **Add exception** to [add exceptions to the rule](match-entities.md#add-exceptions-to-a-rule). Exceptions are used to address rare cases of false positives and false negatives.

   1. Select **Done** to create the rule.

1. Optionally, [add more rules](#define-deduplication-rules).

1. Select an entity and then **Edit merge preferences**.

1. In the **Merge preferences** pane:
   1. Choose one of three options to determine which record to keep if a duplicate is found:
      - **Most filled**: Identifies the record with most populated attribute fields as the winner record. It's the default merge option.
      - **Most recent**: Identifies the winner record based on the most recency. Requires a date or a numeric field to define the recency.
      - **Least recent**: Identifies the winner record based on the least recency. Requires a date or a numeric field to define the recency.

      In the event of a tie, the winner record is the one with the MAX(PK) or the larger primary key value.

   1. Optionally, to define merge preferences on individual attributes of an entity, select **Advanced** at the bottom of the pane. For example, you can choose to keep the most recent email AND the most complete address from different records. Expand the entity to see all its attributes and define which option to use for individual attributes. If you choose a recency-based option, you also need to specify a date/time field that defines the recency.

   1. Select **Done** to apply your merge preferences.

1. After defining the deduplication rules and merge preferences, select **Next**.
