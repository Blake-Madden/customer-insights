# Suggested segments based on activity (preview)

Discover interesting segments of your customers based on customer activity data that is ingested to Customer Insights. Examples of activity data are transactions, support call duration, purchases, or returns. To suggest segments, activity data gets analyzed for recency, frequency, and monetary value (or duration). Alternatively, you can generate [suggested segments to improve a measure or better understand what influences an attribute](suggested-segments.md).

## Categorize customers by activity

With [activity data](activities.md) available in Customer Insights, we can generate suggestions that represent customer groups:

- most active customers 
- customers that have made the most purchases 
- customers that generated the most revenue 
- customers who havenâ€™t been active lately 
- customers who frequently interact with your business  

If you have a retail business, you could find out which customers generate the most revenue and reward them with a coupon. Or you can identify occasional customers and offer them to join a rewards program so they visit your business more often.
If you provide public healthcare and your goal is to minimize the expenses for individual patients, you could try to reduce recurring visits by providing the best possible care in as few visits as possible. In this case, your goal is to keep the visit frequency low and minimize recurring cost for the patients. Or you can identify segments of patients who have frequent appointments and high recurring costs and analyze these cases to improve the treatment of the individual.

## Required data

Suggestions are generated based on the selected input data.

- Customer profiles: All customers or members of a specific segment.

- Time period: Last month, last year, or any custom time frame.

- Activity type: purchases, retail transactions, online transactions, customer support cases, subscriptions, and so on.  

- Entity in Customer Insights that contains the activity data: The UnifiedActivity entity or the entity for a specific activity.

- Dimensions to include: Recency, frequency, or monetary dimension, depending on your business requirements.

Depending on the number of customer profiles and selected activities, it can take a few minutes to complete.

After generating the suggestions, you can filter them by the dimension or value you're most interested in.

## Manage suggested segments

Go to **Data** > **Segments** and select the **Suggestions (preview)** tab. In the **Activity-based suggestions** section, select a suggested segment to view available actions.

- **See suggestion** to view the details of that segment like the extent of each dimension in comparison to the target group. It also highlights the number of potential members in the segment and the corresponding percentage of the total customers.
