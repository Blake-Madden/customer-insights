# Experience Customer Insights in 5 minutes

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights provides ingestion of a single data source to get you up and running quickly. You can provide your own data in a .csv or .xlsx file or choose sample data.

## Prerequisites

- File must be a CSV or Excel file
- File must contain more than 100 rows and 5 columns
- File must include at least one column of each data category:
  - Identity: Customer number, email, SSN
  - Demographics: Address, DOB, gender
  - Business: Loyalty points, total spending

## Ingest single data source

1. Select **Get started**.

1. To use your own data, browse or drag and drop your file. To use sample data, select **Download Microsoftâ€™s sample data**.

   If the file meets the prerequisites, Customer Insights checks the data quality. Customer Insights then removes duplicate records and creates customer profiles.

1. Map data to create insights?

The **Results** page displays:
- Data quality checks which can be viewed in a report
- Number of mapped columns
- Number of missing rows identified
- Number of duplicate data identified
- Suggested segments and measures
