> [!TIP]
> [Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/export-to-data-lake) is a generally available service that offers seamless, continuous replication of data from Microsoft Dataverse to Azure Data Lake. We recommend you use Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse instead of Customer Insights' [data-out exports](/dynamics365/customer-insights/data/export-destinations#export-types) for further data processing of the tables generated by Customer Insights:
>
> - Unified customer profiles (*msdynci_customerprofile*)
> - Unified activities (*msdynci_unifiedactivity*)
> - Segment membership (*msdynci_segmentmembership*)
> - Customer attribute-based measures (*msdynci_measure*)
> - Enrichment data (*msdynci_enrichment*)
> - Prediction model output (*msdynci_prediction*)
