You can ask your own questions to help clarify concepts or understand what you need to do achieve your goals in Customer Insights - Data.

## What are capabilities of the docs-based Q&A skill?

This Copilot capability is to answer user's question by using the ["Generative Answers" service](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-virtual-agents/nlu-boost-conversations#ai-response-generation-training-model-and-usage-notes). The answers are based solely on the following public available sources: Product's public documentation, related [troubleshooting pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/dynamics-365/customer-insights/welcome-customer-insights) and a blogs by the Microsoft team on how to setup Customer Insights - Data. These sources are organized as a Bing Search index, which is the reason for Copilot showing the disclaimer about Bing Search being used for certain capabilities.
