# Security overview

Keeping your data secure is essential to your business. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data restricts access to only the users in your organization that are added by an admin. A dedicated key vault can be used to help meet your organization's compliance requirements. To review data access requests, Customer Insights - Data uses the Power Platform Customer Lockbox capability. Use the following links to learn more about security and compliance in Customer Insights - Data.
