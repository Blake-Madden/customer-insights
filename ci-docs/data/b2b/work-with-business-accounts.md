# Business accounts (B2B) and Customer Insights

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku](../includes/consolidated-sku.md)]

Dynamics 365 Customers Insights previously offered two distinct, standalone modes: Individual consumers known as B2C and Business accounts known as B2B. These modes and terms can be misleading because the individual consumers mode, which unifies and creates segments of people, meets the requirements of most companies, including those doing account-based marketing.

In September 2023, Customer Insights moved to a single mode with Customer Insights - Data that supports B2C functionality. Microsoft is improving Customer Insights - Data to provide functionality for both individual consumers and business accounts in a single environment that seamlessly integrates with Dynamics 365 account data.

Microsoft aims at adding advanced account features to Customer Insights - Data in the future. Meanwhile, current B2B customers can still use their existing B2B Customer Insights environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy B2B version won't be updated with new features being added to the standard version of Customer Insights - Data.

 For information on features supported for the legacy B2B environment, see [supported feature areas for B2B environments](supported-features-b2b.md).
