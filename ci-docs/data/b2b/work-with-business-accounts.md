# Business accounts (B2B) and Customer Insights

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku](../includes/consolidated-sku.md)]

Dynamics 365 Customers Insights previously offered two distinct, standalone modes: Individual customers known as B2C and business accounts known as B2B. These terms can be misleading in that B2C meets the requirements of most companies, including those doing account-based marketing.

In September 2023, Customer Insights moved to a single mode with Customer Insights - Data that supports B2C functionality. Microsoft is improving Customer Insights - Data to provide functionality for both individual customers and business accounts in a single environment that seamlessly integrates with Dynamics 365 account data.

Advanced account features such as dual unification, hierarchy relationships, and account enrichment will be added to Customer Insights - Data in the future. Meanwhile, current B2B customers can still use their existing B2B Customer Insights environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy B2B version won't be updated with new features being added to the standard version of Customer Insights - Data. Features added since September 2023 such as copilot capabilities, Delta table data sources, and native linking aren't supported.

 For information on features supported for the legacy B2B environment, see [supported feature areas for B2B environments](supported-features-b2b.md).
