# Create a new environment

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku](./includes/consolidated-sku.md)]

After [purchasing a subscription license for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](paid-license.md), the global administrator of the Microsoft 365 tenant receives an email that invites them to create the environment. Go to [https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/start](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/start) to get started. In this scenario, start with [Step 1: Provide basic information](#step-1-provide-basic-information).

After the first environment is created, the global administrator of the Microsoft 365 tenant can [add users from their organization as administrators](permissions.md). These administrators can then manage users and environments. If your organization purchases more than one license for Customer Insights, [contact our support team](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2079641) to increase the number of available environments. For more information about capacity and add-on capacity, review the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544). Once you have the ability to create additional environments, go to [Start the environment creation process](#start-the-environment-creation-process).

> [!TIP]

## Prerequisites

[Administrator permissions](permissions.md) in Customer Insights

## Start the environment creation process

1. Open the environment picker and select **+ New**.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/environment-picker.png" alt-text="Select the environment picker.":::

1. Follow the guided experience outlined in the following sections to provide all required information for a new environment.

## Step 1: Provide basic information

1. Choose whether you want to create an environment from scratch or copy data from another environment. [Copying data from another environment](#copy-the-environment-configuration) requires additional steps.

   :::image type="content" source="media/environment-settings-dialog.png" alt-text="Dialog to create a new Customer Insights environment.":::

1. Provide the following details:

   - **Name**: Name for this environment. This field is already filled in if you've copied an existing environment, but you can change it.
   - **Type**: Type of environment: production or sandbox. Sandbox environments don't allow scheduled data refresh and are intended for pre-implementation and testing. Sandbox environments use the same primary audience as the production environment that's currently selected.
   - **Region**: Region into which the service is deployed and hosted. To [use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md) or [connect to an existing Microsoft Dataverse organization](customer-insights-dataverse.md), the Customer Insights environment must be in the same region.

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 2: Configure data storage

1. Choose where to store the Customer Insights data:

   - **Customer Insights storage**: Data storage is managed automatically. It's the default option and unless there are specific requirements to store data in your own storage account, we recommend using this option.
   - **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Your own Azure Data Lake Storage account to store the data so you have full control where the data is stored. Follow the steps in [Use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md).

   :::image type="content" source="media/data-storage-environment.png" alt-text="Choose the preferred option to store your data.":::

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 3: Connect to Microsoft Dataverse

Your Customer Insights environment requires a Microsoft Dataverse environment attached to it. Select an existing Dataverse environment that doesn't already have a Customer Insights environment attached to it. Or you can choose to have a new Microsoft Dataverse environment created and attached.Â Additionally, if you chose to use your own Azure Data Lake storage in the previous step, you can enable data sharing with Dataverse to use it with business applications based on Dataverse, like Dynamics 365 Marketing or model-driven applications in Power Apps.

1. Follow the steps in [Work with Customer Insights data in Microsoft Dataverse](customer-insights-dataverse.md).

   :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-provisioning.png" alt-text="data sharing with Microsoft Dataverse auto-enabled for net new environments.":::

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 4: Finalize the settings

Review the specified settings. When everything looks complete, select **Create** to set up the environment.

To change some of the settings later, see [Manage environments](manage-environments.md).

## Work with your new environment

Review the following articles to help you get started with configuring Customer Insights:

- [Get started with Customer Insights in minutes with a single CSV file](data-sources-single.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > [!INCLUDE [single-file-us-only](includes/single-file-us-only.md)]

- [Add more users and assign permissions](permissions.md).
- [Ingest several of your data sources](data-sources.md) and run them through the [data unification process](data-unification.md) to get [unified customer profiles](customer-profiles.md).
- [Enrich the unified customer profiles](enrichment-hub.md) or [run predictive models](predictions.md).
- [Create segments](segments.md) to group customers and [measures](measures.md) to review KPIs.
- [Set up connections](connections.md) and [exports](export-manage.md) to process subsets of your data in other applications.

## Copy the environment configuration

As an admin, if you chose to copy the configuration from an existing environment, select from the list of all available environments in your organization.

:::image type="content" source="media/environment-settings-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the settings options in the environment settings.":::

The following configuration settings are copied:

- Data sources imported via Power Query
- Data unification configuration
- Segments
- Measures
- Relationships
- Activities
- Search & filter index
- Exports
- Refresh schedule
- Enrichments
- Prediction models
- Role assignments

### Set up a copied environment

When you copy the environment configuration, a confirmation message displays when the copied environment has been created. Perform the following steps to confirm credentials.

1. Select **Go to data sources** to see the list of data sources. All the data sources show **Credentials Required** status.

   :::image type="content" source="media/data-sources-copied.png" alt-text="List of data sources that were copied and need authentication.":::

1. Edit the data sources and enter the credentials to refresh them. Data sources from the Common Data Model folder and Dataverse must be created manually with the same name as in the source environment.

1. After refreshing the data sources, go to **Data** > **Unify**. Here you'll find settings from the source environment. Edit them as needed or select **Unify** > **Unify customer profiles and dependencies** to start the data unification process and create the unified customer table.

1. When the data unification is complete, go to **Insights** > **Measures** and **Insights** > **Segments** to refresh them.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections** to reauthenticate the connections in your new environment.

1. Go to **Data** > **Enrichment** and **Data** > **Exports** to reactivate them.
