# Manage data sources

Go to **Data** > **Data sources** to view the name of each ingested data source, its status, and the last time the data was refreshed for that source. You can sort the list of data sources by any column or use the search box to find the data source you want to manage.

Select a data source to view available actions.

:::image type="content" source="media/data_sources_showmore.png" alt-text="Data source added.":::

- [**Edit**](data-sources.md) the data source to change its properties. You can't edit a single CSV data source that was used to automatically generate insights.
- [**Refresh**](#refresh-data-sources) the data source to include the latest data.
- [**Enrich**](data-sources-enrichment.md) the data source before unification.
- **Delete** the data source. A data source can be deleted only if the data is not used in any processing such as unification, insights, activations, or exports.

If you have a Data Lake data source, you can [convert it to a Delta Lake data source (preview).](convert-datalake-to-deltalake.md)

## Refresh data sources

Data sources can be refreshed on an automatic schedule or refreshed manually on demand. [On-premises data sources](connect-power-query.md#add-data-from-on-premises-data-sources) refresh on their own schedules, which are set up during data ingestion.

For attached data sources, data ingestion consumes the latest data available from that data source.

Go to **Settings** > **System** > [**Schedule**](schedule-refresh.md) to configure system-scheduled refreshes of your ingested data sources.

To refresh a data source on demand:

1. Go to **Data** > **Data sources**.

1. Select the data source you want to refresh and select **Refresh**. The data source is now triggered for a manual refresh. Refreshing a data source will update both the table schema and data for all the tables specified in the data source.

1. Select the status to open the **Progress details** pane and view the progress. To cancel the job, select **Cancel job** at the bottom of the pane.

## Corrupt data sources

Data being ingested may have corrupt records that can cause the data ingestion process to complete with errors or warnings.

> [!NOTE]
> If data ingestion completes with errors, subsequent processing (such as unification or activity creation) that leverages this data source will be skipped. If ingestion completed with warnings, subsequent processing continues but some of the records may not be included.

These errors can be seen in the task details.

Corrupt records are shown in system-created tables.

### Fix corrupt data

1. To view the corrupt data, go to **Data** > **Tables** and look for the corrupted tables in the **System** section. The naming schema of corrupted tables: 'DataSourceName_tableName_corrupt'.

1. Select a corrupt table and then the **Data** tab.

1. Identify the corrupt fields in a record and the reason.

   :::image type="content" source="media/corruption-reason.png" alt-text="Corruption reason." lightbox="media/corruption-reason.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Data** > **Tables** only show a portion of the corrupt records. To view all the corrupt records, export the files to a container in the storage account using the [export process](export-destinations.md). If you used your own storage account, you can also look at the Customer Insights folder in your storage account.

1. Fix the corrupted data. For example, for Azure Data Lake data sources, [fix the data in the Data Lake Storage or update the data types in the manifest/model.json file](common-data-ingestion-errors.md#common-reasons-for-ingestion-errors-or-corrupt-data-with-azure-data-lake-storage). For Power Query data sources, fix the data in the source file and [correct the data type in the transformation step](common-data-ingestion-errors.md#common-reasons-for-ingestion-errors-or-corrupt-data-with-power-query) on the **Power Query - Edit queries** page.

After the next refresh of the data source, the corrected records are ingested to Customer Insights - Data and passed on to downstream processes.

For example, a 'birthday' column has the datatype set as 'date'. A customer record has their birthday entered as '01/01/19777'. The system flags this record as corrupt. Change the birthday in the source system to '1977'. After an automated refresh of data sources, the field now has a valid format and the record is removed from the corrupted table.
