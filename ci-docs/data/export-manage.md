# Set up and manage exports (preview)

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-banner](includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku](./includes/consolidated-sku.md)]

All exports follow the same general set up and management process. You can also schedule exports.

## Set up a new export

To set up or edit an export, you need the right connections available to you. Connections depend on your [user role](permissions.md):
- **Administrators** have access to all connections. They can also create new connections when setting up an export.
- **Contributors** can have access to specific connections. They depend on administrators to configure and share connections. The exports list shows contributors whether they can edit or only view an export in the **Your permissions** column. For more information, go to [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).
- **Viewers** can only view existing exportsâ€”not create them.

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. Select **Add export** to create a new export.

1. In the **Set up export** pane, select which [connection](connections.md) to use.

1. Provide the required details and select **Save** to create the export. For the required details, review the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data documentation for the specific export.

## Manage existing exports

Go to **Data** > **Exports** to view the exports, their connection name, connection type, and status. All user roles can view configured exports. You can sort the list of exports by any column or use the search box to find the export you want to manage.

Select an export to view available actions.

- **View** or **Edit** the export. Users without edit permissions select **View** instead of **Edit** to see the export details.
- **Run** the export to export the latest data.
- **Create duplicate** of an export.
- **[Schedule](#schedule-and-run-exports)** the export.
- **Detach connection** to remove the connection for this export. Detach does not remove the connection, but deactivates the export. The **Connection used** column displays No Connection.
- **Remove** the export.

## Schedule and run exports

Each export you configure has a refresh schedule. During a refresh, the system looks for new or updated data to include in an export. By default, exports are run as part of every [scheduled system refresh](schedule-refresh.md). You can customize the refresh schedule or turn it off to run exports manually.

> [!TIP]
> Minimize the processing time of segment exports with the following best practices:
> - Distribute segment tables across multiple exports.
> - Avoid scheduling all exports at the same time. Leave 30 minutes or one hour between the scheduled time of each export.

Export schedules depend on the state of your environment. If there are updates in progress on [dependencies](system.md#refresh-processes) when a scheduled export should start, the system will first complete the updates and then run the export. The **Refreshed** column shows when an export was last refreshed.

### Schedule exports

Define custom refresh schedules for individual exports or several exports at once. The currently defined schedule is listed in the **Schedule** column of the export list. The permission to change the schedule is the same as [editing and defining exports](#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. Select the export you want to schedule.

1. Select **Schedule**.

1. In the **Schedule export** pane, set the **Schedule run** to **On** to run the export automatically. Set it to **Off** to refresh it manually.

1. For automatically refreshed exports, choose a **Recurrence** value and specify the details for it. The time defined applies to all instances of a recurrence. It's the time when an export should start refreshing.

1. Select **Save**.

When editing the schedule for several exports, make a selection under **Keep or override schedules**:

- **Keep individual schedules**: Keep the previously defined schedule for the selected exports and only disable or enable them.
- **Define new schedule for all selected exports**: Override the existing schedules of the selected exports.

### Run exports on demand

To export data without waiting for a scheduled refresh, go to **Data** > **Exports**.

- To run all exports, select **Run all** in the command bar. Only exports that have an active schedule are run. To run an export that is not active, run a single export.
- To run a single export, select it in the list and select **Run** in the command bar.
