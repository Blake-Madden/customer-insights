Azure Maps provide location-centric data and services to deliver experiences based on geospatial data with built-in location intelligence. Azure Maps data enrichment services improve the precision of location information about your customers. It brings capabilities like address normalization and latitude and longitude extraction to Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure Maps subscription. To get a subscription, [sign up or get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-maps/).

- An Azure Maps [connection](connections.md) is [configured](#configure-the-connection-for-azure-maps) by an administrator.

## Configure the connection for Azure Maps

You must be an [administrator](user-roles.md#admin) in Customer Insights - Data and have an active Azure Maps API key.

1. Select **Add connection** when configuring an enrichment, or go to **Settings** > **Connections** and select **Set up** on the Azure Maps tile.

1. Enter a name for the connection and a valid Azure Maps API key.

1. Review the [data privacy and compliance](connections.md#data-privacy-and-compliance) and select **I agree**.

1. Select **Verify** to validate the configuration and then select **Save**.

## Configure the enrichment

1. Go to **Data** > **Enrichment** and select the **Discover** tab.

1. Select **Enrich my data** on the **Location** from Microsoft Azure Maps tile.

1. Review the overview and then select **Next**.

1. Select the connection. Contact an administrator if no connection is available.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the **Customer data set** and choose the profile or segment you want to enrich with data from Microsoft. The *Customer* table enriches all your customer profiles whereas a segment enriches only customer profiles contained in that segment.

1. Define which type of fields from your unified profiles to use for matching: the primary and/or secondary address. You can specify a field mapping for both addresses and enrich the profiles for both addresses separately. For example, for a home address and a business address. Select **Next**.

1. Map your fields to the location data from Azure Maps. The **Street 1** and **Zip/Postal Code** fields are required for the selected primary and/or secondary address. For higher match accuracy, add more fields.

1. Select **Next** to complete the field mapping.

1. Review **Advanced Settings** which offer maximum flexibility to handle advanced use cases. However, the following default values typically don't need to be changed.

   - **Type of addresses**: Best address match returns even if it's incomplete. To get only complete addresses&mdash;for example, addresses that include the house number&mdash;clear all the checkboxes except **Point Addresses**.
   - **Language**: Addresses return in the language based on the address region. To apply a standardized address language, select the language from the dropdown menu. For example, selecting **English** returns **Copenhagen, Denmark** instead of **KÃ¸benhavn, Danmark**.
   - **Maximum number of results**: Number of results per address.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Provide a **Name** for the enrichment and the **Output table name**.

1. Select **Save enrichment** after reviewing your choices.

1. Select **Run** to start the enrichment process or close to return to the **Enrichments** page.
