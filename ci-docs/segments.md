# Segments overview

Segments let you group your customers based on demographic, transactional, or behavioral attributes. Use segments to target promotional campaigns, sales activities, and customer support actions to achieve your business goals.

Customer or contact profiles that match the filters of a segment definition are referred to as *members* of a segment. Some [service limits](/dynamics365/customer-insights/service-limits) apply.

## Create a segment

Choose how to create a segment based on your target audience.

# [Individual consumers (B-to-C)](#tab/b2c)

- Complex segments with segment builder: [Build your own](segment-builder.md)
- Simple segments with one operator: [Quick segment](segment-quick.md)
- AI-powered way to find similar customers: [Similar customers](find-similar-customer-segments.md)
- AI-powered suggestions based on measures or attributes: [Suggested segments based on measures](suggested-segments.md)
- Suggestions based on activities: [Suggested segments based on customer activity](suggested-segments-activity.md)

# [Business accounts (B-to-B)](#tab/b2b)

Segment of accounts or segment of contacts (preview) with segment builder: [Build your own](segment-builder.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Most export destinations require contact information for Marketing purposes. Therefore, create segments of contacts to use for those exports.

## Manage existing segments

Go to the **Segments** page to view the segments you created, their status and state, and the last time the data was refreshed. You can sort the list of segments by any column or use the search box to find the segment you want to manage.

> [!TIP]
> In B-to-B environments, the **Audience Type** column identifies whether a segment is based on accounts or contacts.

Select a segment to view available actions.

- [**View**](#view-segment-details) the segment details, including member count trend and a preview of segment members.
- **Download** the list of members as a .CSV file.
- **Edit** the segment to change its properties.
- **Create duplicate** of a segment. You can choose to edit its properties right away or save the duplicate.
- **Refresh** the segment to include the latest data.
- **Activate** or **Deactivate** the segment. Inactive segments won't get refreshed during a [scheduled refresh](#schedule-a-segment) and have the **Status** listed as **Skipped**, indicating that a refresh wasn't even attempted. Active segments are refreshed based on their type: static or dynamic.
- **Make static** or **Make dynamic** the segment type. Static segments must be refreshed manually. Dynamic segments are automatically refreshed during scheduled refreshes.
- [**Find similar customers**](find-similar-customer-segments.md) from the segment.
- **Rename** the segment.
- **Tag** to [manage tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#manage-tags) for the segment.
- [**Manage exports**](#export-segments) to see export-related segments and manage them. [Learn more about exports.](export-destinations.md)
- **Delete** the segment.
- [**Schedule**](#schedule-segments) the segment.
- **Columns** to [customize the columns](work-with-tags-columns.md#customize-columns) that display.
- **Filter** to [filter on tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#filter-on-tags).
- **Search name** to search by segment name.

## View segment details

On the **Segments** page, select a segment to view the processing history and segment members.

The upper part of the page includes a trend graph that visualizes changes in member count. Hover over data points to see the member count on a specific date. Change the time frame of the visualization.

:::image type="content" source="media/segment-time-range.png" alt-text="Segment time range.":::

The lower part contains a list of the segment members.

> [!NOTE]
> Fields that appear in this list are based on the attributes of your segment's entities.
>
> The list is a preview of the matching segment members and shows the first 100 records of your segment so that you can quickly evaluate it and review its definitions if needed. To see all matching records, select **See more** which opens the [**Entities**](entities.md) page or [export the segment](export-destinations.md).

## Export segments

Export segments to other apps to further use the data. Export a segment from the segments page or the [exports page](export-destinations.md).

1. Go to the **Segments** page and select the segment you want to export.

1. Select **Manage exports**. The page **Exports (preview) for segment** opens. View all configured exports grouped by whether they contain the current segment or not.

   1. To add the selected segment to an export, **Edit** the respective export to select the corresponding segment, then save. In environments for individual customers, select the export in the list and select **Add segment** to achieve the same outcome.

   1. To create a new export with the selected segment, select **Add export**. For more information about creating exports, see [Set up a new export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Select **Back** to return to the main page for segments.

## Schedule segments

Segments can be refreshed based on the [scheduled system refresh](schedule-refresh.md), weekly, monthly, or refreshed manually on demand. The default is every scheduled system refresh. For example, you might want to schedule segments that don't change often or are for last season on a slower cadence such as monthly to avoid unnecessary processing time.

For scheduled refreshes, the following rules apply:
- All segments with the type **Dynamic** or **Expansion** are automatically refreshed at the set schedule. Once the refresh is complete, the **Status** indicates if there were any issues in refreshing the segment. **Last refreshed** shows a timestamp of the last successful refresh. If an error occurs, select the error to see details about what happened.
- Segments with the type **Static** *won't* be refreshed automatically. **Last refreshed** shows a timestamp of the last time the static segment was run or refreshed manually.

Define refresh schedules for individual segments or several segments at once. The currently defined schedule is listed in the **Schedule** column of the segment list.

1. Go to **Segments**.

1. Select one or more segments you want to schedule.

1. Select **Schedule**.

1. In the **Schedule** pane, set the **Schedule run** to **On** to run the segment automatically. Set it to **Off** to refresh it manually.

1. For automatically refreshed segments, select the **Recurrence** value and the details for it. On the scheduled day, the refresh occurs during the time of the scheduled system refresh.

1. When defining the schedule for several segments, make a selection under **Keep or override schedules**:
   - **Keep individual schedules**: Keep the previously defined schedule for the selected segments and only disable or enable them.
   - **Define new schedule for all selected Segmentations**: Override the existing schedules of the selected segments.

1. Select **Save**.

1. To view the next refresh scheduled for a segment, on the **Segments** page, select **Columns** and add the **Next refresh** column.

## Track usage of a segment

If you use segments in apps which are based on the same Microsoft Dataverse organization that is connected with Customer Insights, you can track the usage of a segment. For [Customer Insights segments used in customer journeys of Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-ci-profile), the system informs you about the usage of that segment.

When editing a segment that is being used within the Customer Insights environment, or in a customer journey in Marketing, a banner in the [segment builder](segment-builder.md) informs you about the dependencies. Inspect the dependency details directly from the banner or by selecting **Usage** in the segment builder.

The **Segment usage** pane shows the details about the usage of this segment in Dataverse-based apps. For segments used in customer journeys, youâ€™ll find a link to inspect the journey in Marketing where this segment is used. If you have permissions to access the Marketing app, view more details there.

:::image type="content" source="media/segment-usage-pane.png" alt-text="Side pane with details of the segment usage in the segment builder.":::

The system informs you about the usage of a tracked segment when you try to delete it. If the segment you're about to delete is used in a customer journey in Marketing, that journey will stop for all users in the segment. If the journey is part of a marketing campaign, the deletion will affect that campaign itself. However, you can still delete the segment despite the warnings.

### Supported apps

Usage is currently tracked in the following Dataverse-based apps:
