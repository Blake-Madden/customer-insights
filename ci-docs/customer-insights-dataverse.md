# Work with Customer Insights data in Microsoft Dataverse

Customer Insights provides the option to make output entities available in [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro). This integration enables easy data sharing and custom development through a low code/no code approach. The [output entities](#output-entities) are available as tables in a Dataverse environment. You can use the data for any other application based on Dataverse tables. These tables enable scenarios like automated workflows through Power Automate or building apps with Power Apps.

Connecting to your Dataverse environment also enables you to [ingest data from on-premises data sources using Power Platform dataflows and gateways](connect-power-query.md#add-data-from-on-premises-data-sources).

## Prerequisites

- Customer Insights and Dataverse environments must be hosted in the same region.
- A global administrator role set up in the Dataverse environment. Verify if this [Dataverse environment is associated](/power-platform/admin/control-user-access#associate-a-security-group-with-a-dataverse-environment) to certain security groups and make sure you're added to those security groups.
- No other Customer Insights environment already associated with the Dataverse environment you want to connect. Learn how to [remove an existing connection to a Dataverse environment](#remove-an-existing-connection-to-a-dataverse-environment).
- A Microsoft Dataverse environment connected to a single storage account if you configure the environment to [use your Azure Data Lake Storage](own-data-lake-storage.md).

## Dataverse storage capacity entitlement

A Customer Insights subscription entitles you to extra capacity for your organization's existing [Dataverse storage capacity](/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage). The added capacity depends on the number of profiles that your subscription uses.

**Example:**

Assuming you get 15 GB database storage and 20 GB file storage per 100,000 customer profiles. If your subscription includes 300,000 customer profiles, your total storage capacity is 45 GB (3 x 15 GB) database storage and 60 GB file storage (3 x 20 GB). Similarly, if you have a B-to-B subscription with 30K accounts, your total storage capacity is 45 GB (3 x 15 GB) database storage, and 60 GB file storage (3 x 20 GB).

Log capacity isn't incremental and fixed for your organization.

For more information about the detailed capacity entitlements, see [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

## Connect a Dataverse environment to Customer Insights

The **Microsoft Dataverse** step lets you connect Customer Insights with your Dataverse environment while [creating a Customer Insights environment](create-environment.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-provisioning.png" alt-text="data sharing with Microsoft Dataverse auto-enabled for new environments.":::

1. Provide the URL to your Dataverse environment or leave blank to have one created for you.

   > [!NOTE]
   > After establishing the connection between Customer Insights and Dataverse, don't change the organization name for the Dataverse environment. The name of the organization is used in the Dataverse URL and a changed name breaks the connection with Customer Insights.

   [Power Platform admins can control who can create a new Dataverse environments](/power-platform/admin/control-environment-creation). If you're trying to set up a new Customer Insights environment and can't, the admin might have disabled the creation of Dataverse environments for everyone except admins.

1. If you're using your own Data Lake Storage account:
   1. Select **Enable data sharing** with Dataverse.
   1. Enter the **Permissions identifier**. To get the permission identifier, [enable data sharing with Dataverse from your own Azure Data Lake Storage](#enable-data-sharing-with-dataverse-from-your-own-azure-data-lake-storage-preview).

## Enable data sharing with Dataverse from your own Azure Data Lake Storage (preview)

In [your own Azure Data Lake Storage account](own-data-lake-storage.md), verify the user setting up the Customer Insights environment has at least **Storage Blob Data Reader** permissions on the `customerinsights` container in the storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> Data sharing is applicable only if you use your own Azure Data Lake Storage account. This setting isn't available if the Customer Insights environment uses the default Dataverse storage.

### Limitations

- Only one-to-one mapping between a Dataverse organization and an Azure Data Lake Storage account. Once a Dataverse organization is connected to a storage account, it can't connect to another storage account. This limitation prevents Dataverse from populating multiple storage accounts.
- Data sharing won't work if an Azure Private Link setup is needed to access your Azure Data Lake Storage account because it's behind a firewall. Dataverse currently doesn't support the connection to private endpoints through Private Link.

### Set up security groups on your own Azure Data Lake Storage

1. Create two security groups on your Azure subscription - one **Reader** security group and one **Contributor** security group and set the Microsoft Dataverse service as the owner for both security groups.

1. Manage the Access Control List (ACL) on the `customerinsights` container in your storage account through these security groups.
   1. Add the Microsoft Dataverse service and any Dataverse-based business applications like Dynamics 365 Marketing to the **Reader** security group with **read-only** permissions.
   1. Add *only* the Customers Insights application to the **Contributor** security group to grant both **read and write** permissions to write profiles and insights.

### Set up PowerShell

Set up PowerShell to execute PowerShell scripts.

1. Install the latest version of [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-adv2).
   1. On your PC, select the Windows key on your keyboard and search for **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.
   1. In the PowerShell window that opens, enter `Install-Module AzureAD`.

1. Import three modules.
   1. In the PowerShell window, enter `Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts` and follow the steps.
   1. Repeat for `Install-Module -Name Az.Resources` and `Install-Module -Name Az.Storage`.

### Execute PowerShell scripts and obtain the Permission Identifier

1. Download the two PowerShell scripts you need to run from our engineer's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/trin-msft/byol).
   - `CreateSecurityGroups.ps1`: Requires tenant admin permissions.
   - `ByolSetup.ps1`: Requires Storage Blob Data Owner permissions at the storage account/container level. This script will create the permission for you. Your role assignment can be removed manually after successfully running the script.

1. Execute `CreateSecurityGroups.ps1` in Windows PowerShell by providing the Azure subscription ID containing your Azure Data Lake Storage. Open the PowerShell script in an editor to review additional information and the implemented logic.

   This script creates two security groups on your Azure subscription: one for the Reader group and another for the Contributor group. Microsoft Dataverse service is the owner for both these security groups.

1. Save both the security group ID values generated by this script to use in the `ByolSetup.ps1` script.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Security group creation can be disabled on your tenant. In that case, a manual setup would be needed and your Azure AD admin would have to [enable security group creation](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management).

1. Execute `ByolSetup.ps1` in Windows PowerShell by providing the Azure subscription ID containing your Azure Data Lake Storage, storage account name, resource group name, and the Reader and Contributor security group ID values. Open the PowerShell script in an editor to review additional information and the implemented logic.

   This script adds the required role-based access control for the Microsoft Dataverse service and any Dataverse-based business applications. It also updates the Access Control List (ACL) on the `customerinsights` container for the security groups created with the `CreateSecurityGroups.ps1` script. The Contributor group is given *rwx* permission and Readers group is given *r-x* permission only.

1. Copy the output string that looks like: `https://DVBYODLDemo/customerinsights?rg=285f5727-a2ae-4afd-9549-64343a0gbabc&cg=720d2dae-4ac8-59f8-9e96-2fa675dbdabc`

1. Enter the copied output string into the **Permissions identifier** field of the environment configuration step for Microsoft Dataverse.

   :::image type="content" source="media/dataverse-enable-datasharing-BYODL.png" alt-text="Configuration options to enable data sharing from your own Azure Data Lake Storage with Microsoft Dataverse.":::

## Remove an existing connection to a Dataverse environment

When connecting to a Dataverse environment, the error message **This CDS organization is already attached to another Customer Insights instance** means that the Dataverse environment is already used in a Customer Insights environment. You can remove the existing connection as a global administrator on the Dataverse environment. It can take a couple of hours to populate the changes.

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select the environment from the environment picker.
1. Go to **Solutions**.
1. Uninstall or delete the solution named **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Customer Card Add-in (Preview)**.

OR

1. Open your Dataverse environment.
1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Solutions**.
1. Uninstall the **CustomerInsightsCustomerCard** solution.

If the removal of the connection fails due to dependencies, you need to remove the dependencies too. For more information, see [Removing dependencies](/power-platform/alm/removing-dependencies).

## Output entities

Some output entities from Customer Insights are available as tables in Dataverse. The sections below describe the expected schema of these tables.

- [CustomerProfile](#customerprofile)
- [ContactProfile](#contactprofile)
- [AlternateKey](#alternatekey)
- [UnifiedActivity](#unifiedactivity)
- [CustomerMeasure](#customermeasure)
- [Enrichment](#enrichment)

- [Segment membership](#segment-membership)

### CustomerProfile

This table contains the unified customer profile from Customer Insights. The schema for a unified customer profile depends on the entities and attributes used in the data unification process. A customer profile schema usually contains a subset of the attributes from the [Common Data Model definition of CustomerProfile](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/foundationcommon/crmcommon/solutions/customerinsights/customerprofile). For the B-to-B scenario, the customer profile contains unified accounts, and the schema usually contains a subset of the attributes from the [Common Data Model definition of Account](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/foundationcommon/crmcommon/account).

### ContactProfile

A ContactProfile contains unified information about a contact. Contacts are [individuals that are mapped to an account](data-unification-contacts.md) in a B-to-B scenario.
