# Create simple segments with quick segments

Quick segments let you build simple segments with a single operator quickly for faster insights. Quick segments are only supported in environments for **individual customers**.

## Create a new segment with quick segments

1. Go to **Segments**.

1. Select **New** > **Create from**.
   - Select the **Profiles** option to build a segment that is based on the *unified customer* entity.
   - Select the **Measures** option to build a segment around measures you have previously created.
   - Select the **Intelligence** option to build a segment around one of the output entities you generated using either the **Predictions** or **Custom Models** capabilities.

1. In the **New quick segment** dialog box, select an attribute from the **Field** dropdown. Based on your selection, the system provides different values.
   - For categorical fields, the 10 top customer counts display. Choose a **Value** and select **Review**.
   - For a numerical attribute, the system shows what attribute value falls under each customer's percentile. Choose an **Operator** and a **Value**, then select **Review**.

1. The system provides an **Estimated segment size**. Choose whether to generate the segment you've defined, or go back to choose a different field.

1. Select **Save** to create your segment. The **Segments** page displays.
