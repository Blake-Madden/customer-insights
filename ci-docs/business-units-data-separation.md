# Business units and data separatation
Purpose and scenarios

## Customer Insights and Dataverse
Customer Insights puts data into Dataverse tables with ownership information, so that data consumption from Dataverse (e.g., in other Dynamics apps, such as Dynamics Marketing, model-driven apps, etc.) is governed by Dataverse RBAC settings (RBAC in DV -> link). 

### Dataverse roles
Access to data in dataverse is governed by the ownership of the information and the Dataverse role of the user.
