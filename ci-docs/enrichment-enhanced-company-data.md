# Enrich company profiles with enhanced company data

Use Microsoft’s models and compiled company data to correct, supplement, and standardize your company profiles. We'll use the [Common Data Model format](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/account) for better accuracy and insights.

You can also [enhance company data on data sources](data-sources-enrichment.md) to improve the match accuracy in the data unification process.

For public companies in the United States, information such as revenue, stock ticker, industry, and more is available.  

## How we enhance company data

Our model goes through a two-step process to enhance a company profile. First, it normalizes the company name. For example, *Microsft Corp* will be corrected and standardized to *Microsoft Corporation*. It tries to find a match in Microsoft's compiled company data. If a match is found, we enrich the company profile with information from our compiled company data, including the company name.

### Example

Your company information might not follow a standardized format and contain spelling errors. The model tries to fix these issues and create consistent information.

```Input
Microsft
```

```Output
- AccountName: Microsoft Corporation
- MainPhoneNumber: 8006427676
- Website: https://www.microsoft.com/
- Street1: One Microsoft Way
- City: Redmond
- StateOrProvince: Washington
- County: King
- ZipOrPostalCode: 98052
- CountryOrRegion: United States
```

## Limitations

The model doesn't:

- Confirm the identity of the company. We don't verify if the input is an existing organization or that a company uses the output as its standard name.
- Comprehensively cover companies globally. Microsoft’s compiled company data has global coverage, but offers most coverage in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States.
- Standardize company addresses globally. We currently support standardizing addresses in these countries or regions: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.
- Guarantee accuracy or freshness of data. As business information often changes, we can't guarantee that the enhanced company data provided is always exact or up-to-date.

### Overview card

The **Customers changes overview** tile shows details about the coverage of the enrichment

- **Companies processed and changed**: The number of customer company profiles that were successfully enriched.
- **Companies processed and not changed**: The number of customer company profiles that were recognized but not changed. This typically happens when the input data is valid and can't be improved by the enrichment.
- **Companies not processed and not changed**: The number of customer company profiles that weren't recognized. This typically happens for input data that are invalid or not supported by the enrichment.
