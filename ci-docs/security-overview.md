# Security overview

Keeping your data secure is essential to your business. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights restricts access to only the users in your organization that are added by an admin. A dedicated key fault can be used to help meet your organization's compliance requirements. To review data access requests, Customer Insights uses the Power Platform Customer Lockbox capability. Use the following links to learn more about security and compliance in Customer Insights.
