# Track usage of a segment

If you use segments in apps which are based on the same Microsoft Dataverse organization that is connected with Customer Insights, you can track the usage of a segment. For [Customer Insights segments used in customer journeys of Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-ci-profile), the system informs you about the usage of that segment.

## Identify the dependencies of a tracked segment

1. When editing a segment that is being used within the Customer Insights environment, or in a customer journey in Marketing, a banner in the [segment builder](segment-builder.md) informs you about the dependencies.

1. Inspect the dependency details directly from the banner or select **Usage** in the segment builder.

The **Segment usage** pane shows the details about the usage of this segment in Dataverse-based apps. For segments used in customer journeys, youâ€™ll find a link to inspect the journey in Marketing where this segment is used. If you have permissions to access the Marketing app, view more details there.

## Delete a tracked segment

When trying to delete a tracked segment, the system informs you about the usage. If the segment you're about to delete is used in a customer journey in Marketing, that journey will stop for all users in the segment. If the journey is part of a marketing campaign, the deletion will affect that campaign itself. However, you can still delete the segment despite the warnings.
