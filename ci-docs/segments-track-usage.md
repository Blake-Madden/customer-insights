# Track usage of a segment

If you use segments in apps which are based on the same Microsoft Dataverse organization that is connected with Customer Insights, you can track the usage of a segment. For [Customer Insights segments used in customer journeys of Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-ci-profile), the system informs you about the usage of that segment.

When editing a segment that is being used within the Customer Insights environment, or in a customer journey in Marketing, a banner in the [segment builder](segment-builder.md) informs you about the dependencies. Inspect the dependency details directly from the banner or by selecting **Usage** in the segment builder.

The **Segment usage** pane shows the details about the usage of this segment in Dataverse-based apps. For segments used in customer journeys, youâ€™ll find a link to inspect the journey in Marketing where this segment is used. If you have permissions to access the Marketing app, view more details there.

The system informs you about the usage of a tracked segment when you try to delete it. If the segment you're about to delete is used in a customer journey in Marketing, that journey will stop for all users in the segment. If the journey is part of a marketing campaign, the deletion will affect that campaign itself. However, you can still delete the segment despite the warnings.
