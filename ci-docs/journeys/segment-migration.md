# Migrate segments to real-time journeys

As announced,  [announced the removal of outbound marketing](transition-overview.md) by June 2025. To avoid any business continuity issues, all customers still using outbound marketing must transition to real-time journeys before this date. OBM Segmentation continues to be one of the most widely used features with customers creating a large number of segments that are being used either in RTM or in OBM journeys. It is now essential for existing customers using OBM segments to migrate to Real Time Marketing (RTM) segments. The ‘Segment Migration Solution’ has been developed to aid this transition, ensuring a smooth and efficient migration process.
