The trial allows you to test the app with sample data and even try out your own customer data. [Learn more about Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys features](real-time-marketing-overview.md)

> [!TIP]
> The trial now includes the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data applications installed on the same Dataverse environment. Prior to September 2023, these were two separate trials on two separate environments.

**To sign up for the trial**:

1. Go to the [trial overview page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/) and select the **Try for free** button.
1. To sign up for a Customer Insights trial, you'll need to use a work or school email address. If you don't have a work or school email address, or if your school or work account is not [managed by Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/), sign up for a [free Office 365 E5 trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5), then use the email address associated with your Office 365 E5 trial to sign up for the Customer Insights trial.

The trial takes a few moments to load, then you can start using the app.
