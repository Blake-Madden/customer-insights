> [!TIP]
> The trial now includes the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys and Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data applications installed on the same Dataverse environment. Prior to September 2023, these were two separate trials on two separate environments.

**To sign up for the trial**:

1. Go to the [trial overview page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/) and select the **Try for free** button.
1. To sign up for a Customer Insights trial, you need to use a work or school email address. If you don't have a work or school email address, or if your school or work account isn't [managed by Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/), sign up for a [free Office 365 E5 trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5), then use the email address associated with your Office 365 E5 trial to sign up for the Customer Insights trial.

The trial takes a few moments to load, then you can start using the app. As of September, 2023 the journeys app in the trial is real-time journeys only.

## Customer Insights - Data trial

To install a Customer Insights - Data trial on the same environment as the Customer Insights - Journeys trial, go to the **Get Started** page in Customer Insights - Journeys and select the **Launch Customer Insights - Data** button on the top banner. This will allow the Customer Insights - Data application to know your environment ID and user ID and add the Customer Insights - Data application to the existing trial environment.

To sign up for a separate Customer Insights - Data trial, go to the [Customer Insights - Data trial sign up form](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?SKU=036c2481-aa8a-47cd-ab43-324f0c157c2d&ali=1&RU=https%3a%2f%2fhome.ci.ai.dynamics.com%2fstart%2ftrial&products=036c2481-aa8a-47cd-ab43-324f0c157c2d&brandingId=28b276fb-d2a0-4379-a7c0-57dce33da0f9) and follow the prompts.
