## How does the Copilot technology work?

The content rewrite copilot assistant is built on a machine learning model called GPT-3.5. Trained on a vast number of text samples from the internet, GPT-3.5 generates new text that looks and sounds similar to text that was written by a human. Copilot masks any personal data in generated ideas and shows only the results that are long enough and unique enough to be useful.

## What data does Copilot collect?

The only time a human review the content of generated ideas is if you report it to Microsoft (using a quick feedback survey built into the content rewrite copilot feature).

## What if I'm not satisfied with the generated content?

Copilot uses your text as a base to generate new suggestions for your email. Make sure to provide in your text the information you want to get across to your audience.
 
If you aren't satisfied with the generated content, try one or more of the following:
1. Continue browsing through generated ideas to make sure you’ve reviewed all of them.
1. Get more ideas using the Regenerate button in the content rewrite dialog.
1. Rephrase your text to get new ideas.

Copilot generates original content, but it isn’t always factual. In addition, because the underlying technology behind content rewrite uses AI that has been trained on a wide range of internet sources, some text suggestions may include questionable or inappropriate content. It's your responsibility to edit generated suggestions so that your final copy is accurate and appropriate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter inappropriate content being generated, report it to Microsoft using this feedback form: [Report abuse](https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/abuse?ThreatType=URL&IncidentType=Responsible%20AI&SourceUrl=https://dynamics.microsoft.com/marketing/overview/). It will help improve the functionality moving forward.
>
> Microsoft may disable the content rewrite copilot feature for selected customers if abuse of the functionality is detected.
