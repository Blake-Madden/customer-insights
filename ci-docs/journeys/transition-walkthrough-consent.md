# Transition consent

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Consent is an essential requirement that allows customers of Customer Insights â€“ Journeys to send marketing messages. Customers that already use outbound marketing can transition consent settings to real-time journeys. Consent management, however, is much more sophisticated in real-time journeys. The differences and how to transition consent is described in the following article: Consent management and double opt-in transition guidance - Dynamics 365 Customer Insights | Microsoft Learn
This article also describes how customers can migrate subscription lists to real-time journeys to send out segment-based newsletters.

When it comes to capturing consent from contacts, sometimes customers have to implement a double opt-in (DOI) feature. As mentioned earlier, this is currently not available in real-time journeys natively. However, the article above also describes how this can be achieved using both modules (outbound marketing and real-time journeys). This could make sense especially if you have already set up DOI in outbound marketing. Customers who want to start with real-time journeys and need DOI implemented will need to wait until this features becomes available.
