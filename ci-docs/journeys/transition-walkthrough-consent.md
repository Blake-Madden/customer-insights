# Transition consent

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Consent is an essential requirement that allows customers of Customer Insights â€“ Journeys to send marketing messages. Customers who already use outbound marketing can transition consent settings to real-time journeys. Consent management, however, is more sophisticated in real-time journeys. The differences and how to transition consent are described in: [Consent management and double opt-in transition guidance](real-time-marketing-consent-transition.md). This article also describes how to migrate subscription lists to real-time journeys to send out segment-based newsletters. For a more detailed discussion, see [Understanding consent management in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys - Dynamics FastTrack Blogs](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=8b2a4ee8-1069-ee11-a81c-000d3a7a1a66)

Customers going through the transition to real-time journeys are recommended to focus initially on moving the journeys and emails themselves, keeping the contact-based consent system in place in outbound marketing. Leveraging the ability to use the outbound marketing subscription centers (see [Use outbound subscription centers in Customer Insights - Journeys](real-time-marketing-outbound-subscription)), emails will be able to respect the previously captured consent and keep updating regardless of whether the journey is built in outbound marketing or real-time journeys. Once all journeys have been transitioned, transition the consent by completing the following steps:
- Create a real-time journeys preference center based on a compliance profile.
- Configure topics that match subscription lists.
-	Use the Load Consent tool to copy consent from contacts and subscription lists.
-	Switch emails to use the newly created compliance profile.
-	Recreate segments based on topics (optional).

When capturing consent from contacts, implementing a double opt-in (DOI) feature is sometimes necessary. DOI isn't currently available in real-time journeys natively. However, the consent management and double opt-in article above also describes how DOI can be achieved using both modules (outbound marketing and real-time journeys). This DOI method could make sense, especially if you've already set up DOI in outbound marketing.

Customers who want to start with real-time journeys and need DOI implemented will need to wait until this feature becomes available.
