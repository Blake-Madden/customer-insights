# Transition consent

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Consent is an essential requirement that allows customers of Customer Insights â€“ Journeys to send marketing messages. Customers that already use outbound marketing can transition consent settings to real-time journeys. Consent management, however, is more sophisticated in real-time journeys. The differences and how to transition consent is described in: [Consent management and double opt-in transition guidance](real-time-marketing-consent-transition.md). This article also describes how you can migrate subscription lists to real-time journeys to send out segment-based newsletters.

When capturing consent from contacts, implementing a double opt-in (DOI) feature is sometimes necessary. DOI isn't* currently available in real-time journeys natively. However, the consent management and double opt-in article above also describes how DOI can be achieved using both modules (outbound marketing and real-time journeys). This DOI method could make sense, especially if you've already set up DOI in outbound marketing.

Customers who want to start with real-time journeys and need DOI implemented will need to wait until this features becomes available.
