      - question: |
          How is Customer Insights - Journeys licensed?
        answer: |
          Customer Insights - Journeys is licensed per tenant, with each tenant priced according to the number of interacted persons stored in your database. To identify contacts, Customer Insights - Journeys monitors key interaction types. Any contact that performs one or more interactions will be flagged as an interacted person and count against the allotment. Here are answers to several of the most frequently asked questions about licensing:
          
          - **What is an interacted person?**  
              An interacted person is any entity (such as a contact, lead, account, or Customer Insights profile) engaged in an interaction. Entities that are stored, but not marketed to using Customer Insights - Journeys interactions don't count towards the interacted people quota. After anâ€¯interaction (see below) is logged for a person. It doesn't matter how many interactions occur on that entity, it is counted once. After an interacted person has not received or engaged an interaction for 12 months, the entity becomes inactive and is no longer counted.

          - **What is an interaction?**  
              An interaction is an outbound message or inbound action (such as a form submission) orchestrated through Customer Insights - Journeys. The interaction can be sent through out-of-box channels available in Customer Insights - Journeys (for example, email, SMS, or push notifications), other Microsoft channels (for example, ACS), or third-party systems integrated with Customer Insights - Journeys (for example, other text message (SMS) providers). Form submissions and other inbound channels are also considered as interactions. Safe use limits allow 10x interactions per interacted person licensed.  
          
          - **Which interacted people count against my quota?**  
              Interacted people are licensed at the tenant level. Therefore, any entities across all Dataverse environments on a tenant where the Customer Insights - Journeys application is orchestrating interactions count toward the total interacted people for the tenant. This is true for any type of environment including production, sandbox, developer, or trial.
          
          - **Where can I see my quotas and quota usage?**  
              To see how many of each quota you've purchased and used, go to **Settings** > **Advanced settings** > **Other settings** > **Quota limits**.
          
          - **What is my monthly interaction quota?**  
              Your monthly interaction quota is equal to 10 times the number of interacted people you have purchased, per month. For example, if you own 1 interacted person, you can interact with them 10 times per month. If you need more than 10 interactions, you should increase the number of interacted people you own to allow for the volume of monthly interactions you need to send. Consider the peak month of the year you need to optimize for and ensure that you have the right amount of interacted people to allow for that volume and corresponding performance.
          
          - **How long is a person considered interacted?**  
              When an entity is interacted with, it is counted as an interacted person and stays that way until it has not been interacted with for 12 months. Interacted person consumption is cumulative throughout the license period and even post-license extension, subject to the 12-month rule mentioned above.

      - question: |
          Why is my instance (organization) incompatible with Customer Insights - Journeys?
        answer: |
          Your tenant might have several different types of instances (also called *organizations*) installed on it, including some that are full Dynamics 365 instances and others that are, for example, Power Apps instances (also called *environments*) that include many components of Dynamics 365, but not all of the components required by Customer Insights - Journeys.
          
          When you're setting up your Customer Insights - Journeys, the setup wizard asks you to choose an organization on which to install the app, and the organization selector might show both full Dynamics 365 instances and the lighter Power Apps instances if they're present. You must choose an instance that includes a full Dynamics 365 installation. If you see an error telling you that *this application isn't compatible with the platform of your selected Dynamics 365 organization*, then make sure you have a full Dynamics 365 organization available (where you want to install Customer Insights - Journeys) and choose that one instead.

      - question: |
          Do I have permissions to register applications on Azure?
        answer: |
          One of the requirements for running the [setup wizard](purchase.md) for Customer Insights - Journeys is that you must sign in to Microsoft 365 with a user account that has permissions to register applications on Azure. To find out if you have these permissions, do the following:
          
          1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with the Microsoft 365 account that you want to use to install Customer Insights - Journeys.
          1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** under **Azure services**. On the next page, select **User settings** from the left side navigation.
          
              > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
              > ![Azure user settings](media/faq-azure-user-settings2.png)
          
          1. Check the **App registrations** section on this page. If the **Yes** box is highlighted here, then you have permissions to register applications on Azure. If the **No** box is highlighted instead, try to select the **Yes** box and then select **Save**; if you don't have permissions to make this change, talk to your global administrator for assistance.
          
      - question: |
          Why do I get an authorization failed message when I try to install Customer Insights - Journeys?
        answer: |
          In some cases, when you sign up for a trial of Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365, you receive an organization that is in an *unmanaged* state, which means (among other things) that you can't get permission to install third-party solutions&mdash;including Customer Insights - Journeys. As a result, you see an "authorization failed" error message when you try to install Customer Insights - Journeys.
          
          To fix this, do one of the following:
          
          - If you're just setting up a trial of Customer Insights - Journeys, then consider creating a new trial tenant and set up the Customer Insights - Journeys trial there, as described in [Sign up for a free trial](trial-signup.md).
          - If you want to continue using the tenant where you received this error, then you must convert your unmanaged org into a managed one and then try to install Customer Insights - Journeys again. For instructions on how to do this, see [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/domains-admin-takeover).

      - question: |
          How can I try to install Customer Insights - Journeys again?
        answer: |
          If your setup fails for some reason, you'll be notified by email and/or by a status message in your web browser (if you keep it open during the installation). Often, part of the solution will be to rerun the installation process after waiting for an hour or so. To rerun the installation, do one of the following:
          
          - If you're setting up a [trial](trial-signup.md), you should have received a welcome email that included a link to the installation management area. Find your welcome mail and select the link to launch the installation management area.
          - If you're setting up a production instance, then [access the installation management area](setup.md#install-uninstall-or-update-customer-insights).

      - question: |
          Why can't I see my Customer Insights - Journeys results in other Dynamics 365 apps?
        answer: |
          Customer Insights - Journeys is built to run exclusively on the new Unified Interface for Dynamics 365 applications. Many Dynamics 365 applications support both the new Unified Interface and the older legacy web client interface, but nearly all are moving to Unified Interface.
          
          Customer Insights - Journeys typically shares data with other Dynamics 365 applications running on the same instance, and operates on many of the same database entities, including contacts, leads, accounts, and more. Some Customer Insights - Journeys-specific features, such as displays of analytics and insights from marketing initiatives, require Unified Interface and therefore won't show any data when you view those entities in legacy web client apps.
          
          Also, some administration and customization features, and some integrated user features, may require you to switch to a legacy web client app from time to time, but soon all features are expected to be available on Unified Interface.
