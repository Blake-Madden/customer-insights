# Push notification device registration for application developers

To learn more about the overall approach to setting up push notifications in Customer Insights - Journeys, visit the [Push notification setup overview](real-time-marketing-push-setup-overview.md).

To enable push notifications in Customer Insights - Journeys, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Push notification application configuration](real-time-marketing-push-notification-setup.md)
1. [User mapping for push notifications](real-time-marketing-push-user-mapping.md)
1. [Device registration for push notifications](real-time-marketing-developer-push.md)
1. [Receiving push notifications on devices](real-time-marketing-developer-notifications.md)
1. [Interaction reporting for push notifications](real-time-marketing-developer-push-interactions.md)

This diagram describes the two steps necessary to register devices and users within Customer Insights - Journeys.

## Device registration

To complete the mobile app configuration, the developer must register devices across servers. You should already have the device token, user ID from CI-J (contact ID, lead ID, customer insights profile ID), and mobile application ID from CI-J.

Upon successful call of a device registration request, there's a 202 response. The 202 response only indicates the request was accepted. To confirm a successful request, you need to check the status by using a webhook or calling the status endpoint directly.

### API

#### Device Registration (single):

Sample HTTP Request:

```HTTP
POST {PublicEndpoint}/api/v1.0/orgs/%ORG_ID%/pushdeviceregistration/devices
```

```JSON
{
    "MobileAppId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%",
    "ApnsDeviceToken": "%APNS_TOKEN%"
}
```

Headers:

- **x-ms-track-registration:** when true, the information about registration success/failure is stored and be available through registration status API.
- **x-ms-callback-url:** When not empty, a failed or successful device registration triggers POST request webhook.
- **x-ms-callback-url-headers:** Contains a serialized JSON of a string-to-string dictionary, representing headers passed for webhook requests. Used only when x-ms-callback-url is defined.

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.

Response Body:

When **x-ms-track-registration** is true:

```JSON
{
    "RegistrationRequestId": "%GUID%"
}
```

Otherwise, empty body

#### Definitions

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|MobileAppId| The identifier of the mobile application configured in Customer Insights - Journeys|
|UserId| The user identifier of the contact, lead, or CI Profile from Customer Insights - Journeys|
|ApiToken| Your API token to authorize the request|
|ApnsDeviceToken| The unique device token identifier generated by the application|

#### Device Registration (multiple)

The body of the batch registration contains an array of up to 100 objects representing device registration requests.

```HTTP
POST {PublicEndpoint}/api/v1.0/orgs/%ORG_ID%/pushdeviceregistration/devices/batch
```

```JSON
[
    {
        "MobileAppId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",      
        "UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%",
        "ApnsDeviceToken": "%APNS_TOKEN%"
    },
    {
        "MobileAppId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%",
        "ApnsDeviceToken": "%APNS_TOKEN%"
    }
]
```

Headers:

- **x-ms-track-registration:** when true, the information about registration success/failure is stored and be available through registration status API.
- **x-ms-callback-url:** When not empty, a failed or successful device registration triggers a POST request webhook.
- **x-ms-callback-url-headers:** Contains a serialized JSON of a string-to-string dictionary, representing headers passed for webhook requests. Used only when x-ms-callback-url is defined.

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.

Response Body:

When **x-ms-track-registration** is true: an array of items, each item order corresponds to order from the request body array.

```JSON
[
    {
        "RegistrationRequestId": "%REG_REQUEST_ID%"
    },
    {
        "RegistrationRequestId": "%REG_REQUEST_ID%"
    }
]
```

Otherwise, empty body.

#### Device Registration Status

```HTTP
GET  https://public-eur.mkt.dynamics.com/api/v1.0/orgs/%ORG_ID%/pushdeviceregistration/devices/status/batch
```

Request Body: array of up to 100 items
```JSON
[
    {
        "RegistrationRequestId": "%REG_REQUEST_ID%",
        "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%"
    }
]
```

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.

Response Body: an array of items:

```JSON
[
    {
        "Status": "Pending|Success|Failed",
        "FailureReason": " DuplicateExists|DryRunSendingFailed|DeviceTokenTooLong|FailedToStoreDevice|ApiTokenNotValid " // dry run sending is a verification of device token by sending an invisible notification to mobile app. Such sending failure might happen due to a wrong device token or incorrect/expired mobile app auth data
    },
    {
        "Status": "Pending|Success|Failed",
        "FailureReason": " DuplicateExists|DryRunSendingFailed|DeviceTokenTooLong|FailedToStoreDevice|ApiTokenNotValid " // dry run sending is a verification of device token by sending an invisible notification to mobile app. Such sending failure might happen due to a wrong device token or incorrect/expired mobile app auth data
    }
]
```

Each item order corresponds to the order from request body array.

Important note - there might be two reasons when Status might be stuck in "Pending" state:

1. The original device registration request had invalid API token. To prevent malicious actors from performing a DoS attack against an environment by calling "register device" to lead to infinite throttling, such attempts don't produce storing of registration history. Therefore, there's no information to check success.
1. CRM stays in throttled state for multiple hours, making the status update operation to fail executing its job after multiple retries.
1. Device registration request was made without x-ms-track-registration header provided.

#### Device Registration Status Webhook

If an x-ms-status-callback-url is provided the URL when a device registration is successful or failed, Customer Insights - Journeys accesses the value of the header.

POST to URL provided within **x-ms-status-callback-url** header of device registration request

Body:

```JSON
{ 
    "Status": "Success|Failed", 
    "Signature": "%SIGNATURE%", 
    "FailureReason": " DuplicateExists|DryRunSendingFailed|DeviceTokenTooLong|FailedToStoreDevice|ApiTokenNotValid" 
} 
```

**Note #1**: Signature is HMACSHA256 hash of callback URL calculated using API token as a key. Use the value to verify that Customer Insights - Journeys made the call. Hash the callback URL with the API token on the webhook’s side, using the same algorithm, and comparing the values.

**Note #2:** An attempt to make a request happens once. Any failure to execute a request causes the notification to be lost. Failure types include an incorrect callback URL, REST API call timeout, or unexpected response status code.

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.

Expected Body: Empty body

#### Device Cleanup (single)

It's important to remove devices that are no longer valid from the database to ensure performant message sending. Use the following approach to remove old device, user, application combinations from the devices table.

```HTTP
POST {PublicEndpoint}/api/v1.0/orgs/%ORG_ID%/pushdeviceregistration/devices/cleanup
```

```JSON
{
    "MobileAppId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%",
    "UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "DeviceToken": "%OPTIONAL_FCM_OR_APNS_DEVICE_TOKEN% )"
}
```

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.

#### Definitions

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|MobileAppId| Te identifier of the mobile application configured in Customer Insights - Journeys|
|ApiToken| Your API token to authorize the request|
|UserId| The user identifier of the contact, lead, or CI Profile from Customer Insights - Journeys|
|DeviceToken| The unique device token identifier generated by the application|

#### Device Cleanup (multiple)

It's important to remove devices that are no longer valid from the database to ensure performant message sending. Use the following approach to remove old device, user, application combinations from the devices table.

    "ApiToken": "%API_TOKEN%",
    "UserId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "DeviceToken": "%OPTIONAL_FCM_OR_APNS_DEVICE_TOKEN% )"
}
```

Returns: 202 if provided request is valid, 400 otherwise.
