# Metadata reference for your organization

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](../../includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instance contains a collection of solutions that provide business functionality for marketing features. A solution provides a framework for packaging, installing, and uninstalling *components* that provide specific business functionality. Some examples of a solution component are entities, apps, business rules, charts, dashboards, and so on. For information about all the solution components, see [Solution components](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/solutions-overview#components).

This section provides information about the solutions and entities in a Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys instance (organization). This information might be helpful as you customize and extend your app.
