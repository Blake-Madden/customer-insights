# Analytics overview in Customer Insights - Journeys

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Customer Insights - Journeys's dashboards and cross-journey insights show metrics, views, and insights summarized across single or multiple journeys, providing you with a deep understanding of journey, channel, and content performance. The built-in dashboards focus on measuring delivery, engagement and journey goal attainment, so you can fine-tune the effectiveness of your journeys, channels, and content.

With Customer Insights - Journeys analytics, you can:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of journeys against your objectives.
- Troubleshoot journeys by identifying areas of friction.
- Discover what is working so that you can amplify or recreate the same approach elsewhere.
- Understand the effectiveness of various messages and channels of communication through key delivery and engagement insights.
- Gain insights into your audience's behavior and interests and tailor your marketing efforts to their specific needs.
