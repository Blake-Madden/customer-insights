# Social posts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The [outbound marketing](user-guide.md) module will be removed from Customer Insights - Journeys on June 30, 2025.** To avoid interruptions, transition to real-time journeys before this date. More information: [Transition overview](transition-overview.md)

The posting to social media feature from outbound marketing has no equivalent in real-time journeys. There are currently no plans to incorporate the feature.

> [!TIP]
> If you have questions or comments, visit the [Outbound to real-time transition community forum](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?partialUrl=Outbound-to-Real-Time-Transition)
