> [!WARNING]

# Social posts
The posting to social media feature from outbound marketing has no equivalent in real-time journeys. There are currently no plans to incorporate the feature.

## LinkedIn Lead Gen

LinkedIn Lead Gen capabilities are being removed from outbound marketing on December 2, 2024. We're considering adding LinkedIn Lead Gen to real-time journeys in a future release, but there's no timeline for the feature currently.

Once LinkedIn Lead Gen capabilities are removed, Customer Insights â€“ Journeys will stop receiving data from LinkedIn forms. You won't be able to sign up for new LinkedIn accounts or reauthenticate existing accounts. You'll still be able to access existing data (it won't be removed) and campaigns in LinkedIn will continue unaffected.
