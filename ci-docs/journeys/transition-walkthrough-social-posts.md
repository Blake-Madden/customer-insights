> [!WARNING]
> Social posting and LinkedIn lead generation capabilities will be removed from Customer Insights - Journeys on December 2, 2024.

The posting to social media feature from outbound marketing has no equivalent in real-time journeys. There are currently no plans to incorporate the feature.
