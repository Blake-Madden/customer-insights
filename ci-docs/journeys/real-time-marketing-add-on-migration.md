# Asset library add-on file migration

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](../includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

The [Customer Insights - Journeys library add-on](real-time-marketing-asset-library.md) has been retired and will be removed by **June 30, 2023**. All customers will automatically be migrated to the [unified asset library](upload-images-files.md), which adds support for shared Dynamics 365 features such as support for business units, security roles for asset management and application lifecycle management. Other features, such as automated tagging and smart recommendation for images, will be temporarily removed and added back in upcoming releases.

Files will be automatically copied to the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys unified library. Emails, templates, and content blocks that contain links to assets will be updated as well.

The migration will happen automatically between April and June 2023.

Emails sent *before* migration may include links to assets stored in the add-on library. Those links will become inactive 30 days after migration is complete.
