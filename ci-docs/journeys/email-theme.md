# Copilot - style your emails with AI-assisted themes

This article describes the email theme functionality, which uses Copilot to customize the appearance of email fields, buttons, and text.

## What is the theme functionality?

Theme allows you to control the style of your email elements such as fields, buttons, and text. You can access the theme feature by selecting the brush icon in the right pane of the email designer. Theme applies the same style to all elements of the same type in your email. For example, if you change the color of a text field, all text fields in your email change to the same color.
