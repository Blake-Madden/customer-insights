# Transition overview

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

In July 2023, Microsoft announced significant changes to the former Dynamics 365 Marketing application. The following changes were released to market in September 2023: 
-	The Dynamics 365 Marketing application was renamed to Customer Insights - Journeys.
-	The former Customer Insights application was renamed to Customer Insights - Data.
-	Both applications are now sold together under a single product SKU called Customer Insights.

The real-time journeys module covers most of the functionalities of the outbound module while exceeding its capabilities in many areas. To mitigate uncertainty and confusion, the articles in the "Transition from outbound marketing" section of the documentation walk through how to successfully transition to the real-time journeys module and answer frequently asked questions about this topic.

The following diagram shows how the changes affect new and existing customers:

## Guidance for existing customers

Existing customers are encouraged to transition from outbound marketing to the real-time journeys engine for optimal performance, scale, and to take advantage of ongoing product investments and AI Copilot features.

> [!NOTE]
> After upgrading Dynamics 365 Marketing to Customer Insights - Journeys, existing customers no longer see the outbound marketing module. Existing customers can add back outbound marketing features themselves using a self-serve interface available on the **Settings** > **Versions** page in the Customer Insights - Journeys app.

## Guidance for trials

New trials can only be created with real-time journeys.

## Guidance for new customers

New customers who install Customer Insights - Journeys no longer see the outbound marketing module and can't install it. Because outbound marketing doesn't offer the performance, scale, user experience, and AI copilot capabilities of Customer Insights - Journeys and is no longer being invested in from an engineering perspective, new customers shouldn't start their journey on the old engine.
