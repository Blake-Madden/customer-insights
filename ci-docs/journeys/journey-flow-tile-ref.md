# Journey flow

This article describes the various journey capabilities available in Customer Insights - Journeys. For complete examples of creating customer journeys, see [Create a trigger-based journey](real-time-marketing-trigger-based-journey.md) and [Create a segment-based journey](real-time-marketing-segment-based-journey.md).

## Journey start

The journey start configuration lets you define how customers can start the journey. There are two types of journeys you can create: [Trigger-based journeys](journey-start.md#trigger-based-journey) and [Segment-based journeys](journey-start.md#segment-based-journey). For more information, see [Start a journey](journey-start.md).

## Journey end

By default, customers end the journey when they complete all the steps. You can set additional ways for customers to exit the journey by using triggers or segments such as when an event occurs. For more information, see [End a journey](journey-end.md).
