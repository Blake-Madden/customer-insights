# Use outbound subscription centers in Customer Insights - Journeys

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](../includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

This article explains how to use outbound marketing subscription centers in journeys. Outbound subscription centers give you consent management flexibility, enabling you to have multiple subscription centers customized and branded to your needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only use subscription centers in journeys that target contacts. Journeys that target leads or customer profiles will continue to use the default preference page.

> [!NOTE]
> Customer Insights - Journeys has introduced a new compliance profile type of preference center that works natively with contact point-based consent in Customer Insights - Journeys. Preference centers offer improved functionality, such as more customizable forms and the ability to update text message consent.
