# Use outbound subscription centers in Customer Insights - Journeys

[!INCLUDE [consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

This article explains how to use outbound marketing subscription centers in real-time journeys. This capability enables you to start using real-time journeys before you have moved your consent settings over to the newer Preference Center compliance profiles. We only recommend using a Subscription Center real-time journeys if you're already using outbound marketing to send emails and aren't yet ready to fully transition to real-time journeys. Learn more about transitioning from outbound marketing, visit [Consent management and double opt-in transition guidance](real-time-marketing-consent-transition.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only use subscription centers in journeys that target contacts. Journeys that target leads or Customer Insights - Data profiles should use Preference Centers. Preference centers offer improved functionality, such as more customizable forms and the ability to update text message consent.
