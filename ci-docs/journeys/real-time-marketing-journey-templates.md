# Journey templates

> [!NOTE]
> Due to rollout delays, journey templates aren't available until mid-March 2025.

Journey templates in real-time journeys make it easy for people across your organization with various skill levels to start a journey quickly and ensure it's setup with the right parameters, content, and logic. When starting a journey from a template, journey authors can swap out segments, emails, or other tile content to match the needs of the customer experience they want to deliver without having to build the whole logic tree.

## Creating journey templates

To create a journey template:

- From the template library, **New journey template** opens the journey editor where you can author the desired journey. Choose **Save** and then select **Save as template**. 
- From an existing journey in any state (including those that have completed), choose **Save as template** to turn any existing journey into a template. 
- From the journey editor, author your journey then choose **Save** to enable the **Save as template** option. 

To edit a journey template, you must open one and save as a new template. You cannot edit existing templates: 
 - From the journey editor, choose **New journey** and select the template you want to edit. 
 - Make the desired changes and choose **Save** to enable the **Save as template** option, then select **Save as template** and name it something that doesn't conflict with an existing template. 

You can save journeys as templates with placeholder content selected or only with tiles in place and no content populated.

## Start a journey from a template

Anyone creating a journey can select your template from the list of available templates when creating a journey from scratch in the journey editor.
