# Impact of disabling CDN

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys uses Azure CDN (content delivery network) for caching image embedded in email, as well as lead generation forms and pages outside of the selected Azure geo to ensure performance of our service.

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys may transfer customer data outside of the selected Azure geographic location when using the following features that use Azure CDN (content delivery network) to operate globally:
- [Asset library](upload-images-files.md)
- [Forms](real-time-marketing-form-overview.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Starting February 2024, we will add a feature switch in the product that will allow you to disable using CDN.
> 
> If you decide to not use CDN, you can still execute marketing campaigns without using such features by hosting your assets and forms in a content management system of your choice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you decide not to use CDN, please refer to the list below to understand the impacted product features.
