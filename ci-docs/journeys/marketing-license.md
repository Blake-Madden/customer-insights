# Get started with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights licensing

[!INCLUDE[consolidated-sku-rtm-only](./includes/consolidated-sku-rtm-only.md)]

Before you purchase, provision, and begin using a Customer Insights environment, you'll need to decide which licensing options suit your needs. Purchasing a Customer Insights license involves three components: the base license, additional instances, and additional capacity. This article explains the considerations you should make regarding each component when purchasing the Customer Insights app.

- For information on pricing, visit the [Customer Insights pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/marketing/pricing/).
- To learn more about Dynamics 365 licensing, check out the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customers who purchased before September 2023 may own the legacy, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Dynamics 365 Marketing standalone licenses. The standalone licenses have different entitlements from the new Dynamics 365 Customer Insights license sold after September 2023. The differences are as follows:
>
> - Dynamics 365 Marketing (standalone) entitles 10,000 active contacts (renamed "interacted people" after September 2023) and 1 application installation. You can buy add-on subscriptions to entitle additional application installations.
> - Dynamics 365 Customer Insights (standalone) entitles 100,000 customer profiles (renamed "unified people" after September 2023) and 4 installations of the application. You can buy add-ons to unify accounts.
>
> The current Dynamics 365 Customer Insights license entitles 10,000 interacted people (formerly "active contacts"), 100,000 unified people (formerly "unified profiles"), 4 installations of the journeys app, and 4 installations of the data app. You no longer have to pay a higher unit price for add-ons to unify accounts.

## Step 1: Buy the base license

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights base license includes four application installations of Customer Insights - Journeys and four of Customer Insights - Data. If you own a pre-qualifying Dynamics 365 license, you're entitled to the "attach" pricing. See the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409) for details on pricing and entitlements.

## Step 2: Buy additional capacity

To determine how much capacity you need, consider the following:

-	How many total customers does your business have? You might be able to estimate this by counting the unique email addresses or phone numbers in your database. Buy this number of unified people.
-	For high-volume engagement, how many interactions (email/text message/push notification/custom channel) will you send per month? Divide by 10 to get the number of interacted people you need.
-	For lower-volume engagement, how many leads, contacts, profiles, or custom entities do you think you engage with on an annual basis?

## Next steps

After you've purchased your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights license, you'll need to start setting it up. Learn more in the [purchase and set up Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](purchase.md) article.
