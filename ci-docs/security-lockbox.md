# Securely access customer data with Customer Lockbox (Preview)

Customer Insights uses the Power Platform Customer Lockbox capability. Customer Lockbox provides an interface to review and approve (or reject) data access requests. These requests occur when data access to customer data is needed to resolve a support case. To use this feature, Customer Insights must have an existing connection to a Microsoft Dataverse environment in your tenant.

For more information about Customer Lockbox, see the [summary](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox#summary) of Power Platform Customer Lockbox. The article also describes the [workflow](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox#workflow) and the required [setup](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox#enable-the-lockbox-policy) to enable Customer Lockbox.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Global administrators for Power Platform or Power Platform administrators can approve Customer Lockbox requests issued for Customer Insights.
